# REATful API

## Introduction
In the evolving world of software development, understanding how to communicate and transfer data efficiently between systems is essential. This project delves into the domain of RESTful APIs, a cornerstone in the realm of web services. The Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture is a set of constraints that ensure a scalable, stateless, and cacheable communication system. This approach allows for the easy integration of web services, making them accessible to a wide range of applications.


## Learning Objectives:
HTTP/HTTPS Basics: Grasp the foundational principles of the web’s primary protocol, understanding how data transfer occurs, methods involved, and the difference between the secure and non-secure versions.

API Consumption with Command Line: Hands-on experience in interacting with APIs using basic command-line tools, laying the groundwork for more advanced interactions.

API Consumption with Python: Elevate your data fetching skills by leveraging Python’s capabilities, allowing for more advanced processing and data manipulation.

API Development with http.server: Understand the basics of crafting an API from scratch using Python’s built-in modules, setting a solid foundation.

API Development with Flask: Dive deeper into API development using the lightweight Flask framework, focusing on routing, data management, and scalability.

API Security & Authentication: Address the crucial aspect of security, understanding how to protect data transfer and ensure only authorized access to resources.

API Standards & Documentation with OpenAPI: Conclude with the importance of maintaining standardized documentation, ensuring that APIs are usable, understandable, and maintainable.

## Importance

In our interconnected digital age, RESTful APIs play a pivotal role in the integration of different systems. They serve as the middlemen, translating requests into understandable actions, fetching data, or triggering procedures. From social media platforms sharing data with advertisement agencies to complex industrial systems communicating with each other for automation, APIs are ubiquitous.

Developing a solid understanding of how to consume, develop, secure, and document these APIs equips you with a critical skill set. It’s a blend of understanding both the technical intricacies and the larger design picture, ensuring seamless and efficient communication in the digital world.

### Tasks
0. Basics of HTTP/HTTPS
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It allows web clients (like browsers) to communicate with web servers. HTTP has evolved over time and has a secure counterpart called HTTPS (HTTP Secure). HTTPS is just like HTTP but with an added layer of security using SSL/TLS encryption. This layer protects the data from eavesdroppers and tampering.

Objective:

At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

Differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS.
Understand the basic working and structure of HTTP requests and responses.
Recognize and explain the common HTTP methods and status codes.

1. Consume data from an API using command line tools (curl)
curl (Client URL) is a command-line tool that allows users to transfer data to or from a network server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more). It’s widely used for debugging, testing, and interacting with RESTful web services and APIs. By mastering curl, one can quickly prototype API requests, diagnose server issues, and more, all from the command line.


2. Consuming and processing data from an API using Python
Python, due to its readability and a vast library ecosystem, is a popular choice for interacting with web services and APIs. The requests library simplifies HTTP communication and allows users to send HTTP requests using Python. Once the data is fetched, Python’s built-in libraries and tools enable effortless data manipulation and processing.


3. Develop a simple API using Python with the `http.server` module
The http.server module in Python’s standard library provides basic classes for implementing web servers. While it’s not typically used for production applications, it’s a handy tool for building simple web servers and understanding the basics of web programming without relying on third-party libraries.

4. Develop a Simple API using Python with Flask
Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python, which is especially popular for creating small to medium web applications and RESTful APIs. Its minimalist and modular approach makes it a great choice for beginners to delve into web development without the overhead of more complex frameworks.

5. API Security and Authentication Techniques

API security is of paramount importance, especially when the API is exposed to the wider internet. There are many risks, including unauthorized data access, data tampering, and denial-of-service attacks. One fundamental method of securing APIs is to use authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring only authorized users can access certain resources.
